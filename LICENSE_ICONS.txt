Callisto includes icons from the set "Android Developer Icons 2" by Opoloo.
These icons are NOT released under the OSL.

The icons in question are the ones that are available from the set linked above, specifically the ones that are from the
paid set, not any of the "Bonus Icons" sets.

These icons have been purchased by the main developer (Jon Petraglia) for the development of his Android apps (including
Callisto), and he has obtained expressed permission from Opoloo to use their icons in this Callisto as an open-source
application and include them in the project's revision control.

HOWEVER, this permission ONLY extends to the Callisto project. You are not licensed to download these icons from
Callisto's source control with the intent to use them in your applications, whether open-source or proprietary. This
includes forks of Callisto resulting in a new project.


The folks at Opollo were nice enough (and friendly enough to open-source!) to let me use these icons for Callisto.
Please don't make them regret it. It's a few dollars for some really high quality icons. If I can go further into debt
with my venture of Callisto, you can stand to shell out a few bucks as well.

-Jon Petraglia (main developer of Callisto)


(And for the record, this license was MY idea, NOT Opollo's.)
